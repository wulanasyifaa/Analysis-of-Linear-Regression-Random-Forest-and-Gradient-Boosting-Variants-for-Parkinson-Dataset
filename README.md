# Analysis of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Variants for Parkinson Dataset
In this project, I conducted a regression analysis using the Parkinson Telemonitoring dataset to predict the total UPDRS score based on various vocal features. I explored multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost. After thorough preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, XGBoost delivered the best performance with the highest R² score, consistent with its proven effectiveness in biomedical signal analysis. The project also involved hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to further optimize model accuracy.

Key Insight:
Advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost demonstrate superior capability in handling complex, correlated biomedical features for Parkinson’s disease progression prediction. Proper data preprocessing and feature engineering are crucial to achieving robust and accurate models, supporting early diagnosis and monitoring efforts.
